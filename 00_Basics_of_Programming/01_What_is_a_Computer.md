# 01. What is a Computer?

## Introduction

Welcome to the very beginning of your programming journey! Before we dive into writing code, it's essential to understand what a computer is. Computers are the tools we use to run programs, and programming is all about telling computers what to do. This chapter will explain computers in simple terms, from the basics to how they work, including everything that school children learn about computers.

## What is a Computer?

A **computer** is an electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data. It follows instructions (called programs) to perform tasks like calculating numbers, displaying images, or playing music. Think of a computer as a super-smart assistant that can do many things quickly and accurately.

Computers are machines that help us in many ways:
- They can solve math problems very fast
- They can store lots of information
- They can show pictures and videos
- They can play games and music
- They can help us write stories and draw pictures

## How Does a Computer Work? - Detailed IPO Cycle

Computers work by following a simple but powerful cycle called the IPO Cycle (Input-Process-Output). Let's understand each step in detail:

### 1. Input
- **What happens**: You provide data to the computer
- **How**: Using input devices like keyboard, mouse, scanner
- **Examples**:
  - Typing a letter on keyboard
  - Clicking a mouse button
  - Scanning a photo
  - Recording audio with microphone
- **Data types**: Text, numbers, images, sounds, videos

### 2. Processing
- **What happens**: The CPU processes the data using instructions from programs
- **How it works**:
  - CPU fetches instructions from memory
  - Decodes what the instruction means
  - Executes the instruction
  - Stores results back in memory
- **Binary System**: Computers use only 0s and 1s (binary digits or bits)
- **Machine Language**: The only language computers understand directly

### 3. Output
- **What happens**: Computer shows or produces the results
- **How**: Using output devices
- **Examples**:
  - Displaying text on screen
  - Printing documents
  - Playing sounds through speakers
  - Showing videos

### 4. Storage
- **What happens**: Data can be saved for later use
- **Types**:
  - **Primary Storage**: RAM (temporary)
  - **Secondary Storage**: Hard drives, SSDs (permanent)
- **File Systems**: Ways to organize stored data (folders, files)

### Extended IPO Cycle

The basic cycle can be extended to include more steps:

1. **Input** → 2. **Processing** → 3. **Storage** → 4. **Processing** → 5. **Output**
6. **Storage** (for saving results)
